The ArduinOPDI project is a part of the OPDI reference implementation.

It implements an OPDI slave for Arduinos, allowing you to control Arduino IO ports using a smartphone.

To set up Arduino development for Eclipse, see here: http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php/topic,37788.0.html

Roughly, it works as follows:
1. Install Eclipse
2. Install Eclipse C++ Development Tools
3. Install the Eclipse AVR plugin
4. Install the AVG-GCC toolchain (it's best if you use the toolchain that comes with the Arduino IDE).
