C++ URI class - Originally based on URI from Poco C++ lirary.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Code is standalone and doesn't require original library.
Few modifications has been made to original source files.
Base Poco library version used: 1.4.6p2.

Code Example:
	#include "hef_uri_syntax.h"
	...
	hef::HfURISyntax uri2("http://example.com/index.html?a=1");
	printf("host: %s, port: %d\n", uri2.getHost().c_str(), (int)uri2.getPort() );
	printf("path: %s\n", uri2.getPath().c_str() );

Tested with following C++ compilers:

 * MinGW GCC version 4.7.1
 * MSVC 6.0

List of modifications to original Poco source files:

 * renamed main namespace Poco -> hef.

 * renamed main class URI -> HfURISyntax.

 * removed Poco namespace.

 * replaced instances of std::sprintf() with sprintf().

 * inserted atoi() in place of internal number formatter class.

 * removed throw expressions and made code to return immediatelly instead.
   printf-s are also used instead if set using URI::setPrintErrors().

 * new functions: 
   - static URI::isIPAddress().
   - URI::setPrintErrors().

 * new function toLowerInPlace2() replaces toLowerInPlace(). 
   replaced Ascii::toLower() with tolower() defined in header <cctype>.
   effect: Poco_Striung.h is no more required.

 * changed the way invalid port is handled. now its clamped if
   outside of 0-65535 range. original functionality was exiting with error.

 * new functionality, saves original string of port number.
   this string can be later obtained by URI::getPortAsString().
   may be usefull when expecting that port number may have been auto assigned or not specified.

 * ...
